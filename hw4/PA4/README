Programming Assignment #4

Due date: May 10th, at 11:59pm

Submission rules: Submit a tar file named "PA4.tar". That file must contain a
                  directory named "PA4". In that directory, you must have the
		  files "get", "drop", "break", "turn", and "cantmove". The
		  directory cannot contain any other files.

How to do the assignment: The provided checkYourOutput.sh script tests many
things, but it only requires the "get" script from the PA3solution (which has
been included as a subdirectory in this new posting). So do the "get" script
after you do the other parts.

Note: the cantmoveguidance file was updated slightly from the earlier version.
